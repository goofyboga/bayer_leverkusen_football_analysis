## Overview
11 years is a long time. For 11 consecutive years, the powerhouse of German club Bayern Munich dominated the Bundesliga, winning the title year after year. The German domestic title almost seemed predestined to never be claimed by any other German team again. 
Then in the 2023/2024 season Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen shattered Bayern’s streak, and won their first ever Bundesliga title. And they did it with style, becoming the first and only team to ever go undefeated in the German Bundesliga. Over the decades, 
Leverkusen have been dubbed “Neverkusen” by the media for being runner-ups and their heartbreaking near-misses in major competitions, time and time again. Upon lifting the Bundesliga trophy undefeated,  the “Nearly Men” went from Neverkusen to Neverlusen. 
When the retired Xabi Alonso took over in the previous season, Bayer Leverkusen was languishing in the relegation places and in deep trouble. No one could imagine that only one season later, the Spanish midfield maestro would completely transform the team both 
on and off the pitch. But Alonso’s tactics on the pitch may come as a surprise to many. In a modern era of Guardiola-esque football, for many teams it seems almost a necessity to “relentlessly press” the opposition without the ball and “play out from the back” 
with the ball. Alonso has proven that the possession game can be played just as effectively in his own special way, without needing to conform to these modern standards.

## Data
This project uses event-based match data from Statsbomb to extract tactical insights into Bayer Leverkusen’s playing style. Key focus areas include:

Turnovers & Transition – Where & how they win the ball.
Ball Progression – How they move up the pitch.
Shot Creation & xG – How they generate high-quality chances.
Defensive Structure – Mid-block efficiency & counterpressing success.

To analyze these, the project uses Python, Pandas, and statistical models while visualizing key patterns with matplotlib & mplsoccer (heatmaps, pass networks, shot maps). 
The main footballing concepts that are explored in this project include relationism, territorial dominance (and defensive distance), effective counterpressing and the execution of a midblock.

Note: This project is currently 20% complete. I've deliberately excluded insights and analysis for now, as I want to fully explore all metrics without bias. A comprehensive tactical report on Bayer Leverkusen will be finalized by early March 2025.
